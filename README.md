# CSCI 70900 – Programming in a High Level Language

-In the program here I struggled, but thanks to working in small groups with Ian he really helped me understand the concept of constructors.

"Constructors are like creating a special character ina video game, you can use the default character but if you want you can also create one with the things you like" - Ian Scheffler

# SEDC 71900 – Methods I: Advanced Study of Secondary Learning Environments for Teaching Computer Science

- My approach to teaching computer science is getting alot better this summer. Im going to start teaching AP CSP next year and I was really nervous about it. Working along with my classmates who also teach AP, is allowing me to feel comfortable because I am able to pick up ideas and methods to bring in next year.I will use alot of unplugged activities when introducing new projects.
